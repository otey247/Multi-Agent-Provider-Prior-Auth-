A **provider-side** multi-agent AI solution that helps clinics, hospitals, specialty practices, and revenue cycle teams prepare, validate, and submit prior authorization requests to payers. Four specialized **Foundry Hosted Agents** — Documentation Completeness, Clinical Evidence Retrieval, Policy Matching, and Submission Readiness — assess whether a prior auth package is complete and ready to submit, producing auditable ready-to-submit / needs-review assessments in under 2 minutes. Built with **Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents**, the **Microsoft Agent Framework**, **Azure OpenAI gpt-5.4**, **Azure Container Apps**, and **Foundry Toolboxes** backed by MCP healthcare data servers.

> **Provider-side vs. payer-side:** A payer-side system asks "Should this request be approved or denied?" A **provider-side** system asks "How do we get the right authorization approved as quickly and correctly as possible?" This solution helps providers prepare complete, evidence-backed prior auth packages — it is not a coverage determination engine.

The solution supports **two runtime modes**:

| Mode | How to start | What happens |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Foundry Hosted Agent** (recommended) | `azd up` | Agents are registered with Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents; Foundry manages container lifecycle. The backend dispatches to each agent's dedicated Responses endpoint on the Foundry project using `DefaultAzureCredential`. |
| **Local / Docker Compose** | `docker compose up` | All 4 agent containers + backend + frontend run locally — no Azure deployment needed. |

Decision policy and evaluation methodology adapted from the [Anthropic prior-auth-review-skill](https://github.com/anthropics/healthcare/tree/main/prior-auth-review-skill): submission readiness gate evaluation, per-criterion MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT status, confidence scoring, progressive gate evaluation, structured audit trails, NCCI bundling risk flagging, service-type classification, and provider specialty-procedure appropriateness as an auditable criterion.

## Features

- **Provider-side prior auth workflow** — Helps clinics and hospitals prepare, validate, and submit prior auth packages; not a payer coverage determination engine
- **Multi-agent parallel execution** — Four specialized agents complete a full prior auth assessment in under 2 minutes; Documentation Completeness and Clinical Evidence Retrieval agents run concurrently via `asyncio.gather`
- **Foundry Hosted Agents** — Each specialist agent is independently containerized and deployed on Microsoft Foundry; Foundry manages the container lifecycle
- **Gate-based submission readiness evaluation** — Three sequential gates (Provider Credentials → Code Validation → Payer Policy Requirements) with per-criterion MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT scoring and confidence weighting
- **CMS-0057 / Da Vinci standards layer** — Reusable payer **policy packs** drive CRD (is PA required + routing channel), DTR (a payer-specific requirement checklist mapped to chart evidence), and PAS (a package-readiness preview); surfaced in a Standards Alignment panel and an optional `standards` API block. Packs and completed reviews also export as **FHIR R4 artifacts** (DTR `Questionnaire`, `$questionnaire-package`, pre-populated `QuestionnaireResponse`, and a PAS request `Bundle`) via API and one-click UI downloads. Provider-side and additive — no live payer API is called. See [CMS-0057 / Da Vinci Standards Layer](./docs/cms-0057-standards-layer.md) and the [CMS-0057 / Da Vinci PRD](./docs/prd-cms0057-davinci.md)
- **MCP-powered data access** — Clinical and policy tools are consumed through Foundry Toolboxes (`clinical-tools`, `coverage-tools`) backed by a self-hosted medical-data MCP server (ICD-10, Clinical Trials, NPI Registry, CMS Coverage) and the public PubMed MCP server
- **Human-in-the-loop** — AI produces draft assessments; staff accept or revise with documented rationale; override traceability flows to audit PDF and provider letters
- **Evidence-grounded** — Clinical Evidence Retrieval Agent reports only what is documented; never invents clinical facts; identifies missing evidence explicitly
- **Keyless authentication** — All Azure resource access via `DefaultAzureCredential`; no API keys, passwords, or connection strings stored or rotated
- **Full audit trail** — 10-item documentation completeness checklist, per-criterion confidence scoring, and an 8-section submission readiness report (Markdown + color-coded PDF)
- **Real-time progress streaming** — SSE-based live updates with a phase timeline and per-agent status cards across all four agent phases
- **OpenTelemetry observability** — Native Application Insights integration with custom phase spans and semantic attributes
- **Skills-based architecture** — Agent behaviors defined in `SKILL.md` files; domain experts can update payer policy rules without code changes
- **Two runtime modes** — Deploy to Azure with `azd up` (Foundry Hosted Agents) or run everything locally with `docker compose up`

## Guidance

### Architecture

This solution uses a **stateless dispatcher** pattern: the FastAPI backend has no local AI runtime — all specialist reasoning runs in four independent Foundry Hosted Agent containers. The orchestrator dispatches to each agent's dedicated Responses endpoint on the Foundry project using `DefaultAzureCredential`. See [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for the full design.

### Security

- **Keyless by design** — all Azure resource access uses `DefaultAzureCredential`; no API keys or connection strings are stored anywhere
- **Managed Identity** — each Container App has a system-assigned managed identity with least-privilege Bicep-assigned role assignments (`CognitiveServicesOpenAIUser`, `Azure AI User`)
- **Local auth disabled** — the Azure AI Foundry account has `disableLocalAuth: true`, enforcing Entra ID-only access
- See [Security guidelines](#security-guidelines) below for additional hardening recommendations for production deployments handling PHI

### Responsible AI

This is an **AI-assisted prior auth preparation tool** — all assessments are drafts that require human review before submitting to a payer. The system never makes coverage determinations; that is the payer's role. Coverage policy matching reflects Medicare LCDs/NCDs only; commercial and Medicare Advantage plans may differ. The Clinical Evidence Retrieval Agent is designed to report only evidence that is explicitly documented — it does not invent or fabricate clinical facts. See [TRANSPARENCY_FAQ.md](./TRANSPARENCY_FAQ.md) for full responsible AI transparency details.

## <img src="./docs/images/readme/solution-overview.svg" width="48" /> Solution overview

This solution leverages **Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents**, **Azure OpenAI gpt-5.4**, **Azure Application Insights**, and **Foundry Toolboxes** backed by MCP healthcare data servers to create an intelligent provider-side prior authorization preparation pipeline where four specialized AI agents work together to validate documentation, retrieve clinical evidence, match payer requirements, and assess submission readiness — with full audit transparency and native OpenTelemetry tracing. Each specialist agent is independently containerized and deployed as a Foundry Hosted Agent, while the FastAPI orchestrator and Next.js frontend run in Azure Container Apps.

### Solution architecture

|![Solution Architecture](./docs/images/readme/solution-architecture.svg)|
|---|

### Agentic architecture

The orchestrator coordinates four phases with four specialized agents:

| Agent | Provider-Side Role |
|-------|-------------------|
| Documentation Completeness Agent | Verifies that the request package has all required fields (patient info, NPI, codes, clinical notes) before wasting payer capacity |
| Clinical Evidence Retrieval Agent | Extracts and validates clinical evidence from the submitted notes — reports only what is documented, never invents facts |
| Policy Matching Agent | Verifies provider credentials and maps clinical evidence against known payer requirements (Medicare LCDs/NCDs) |
| Submission Readiness Agent | Aggregates all agent outputs through three readiness gates and produces ready-to-submit / needs-review with confidence scoring |

### Key features

<details open>
  <summary><b>Provider-side prior auth workflow</b></summary>

  - Helps clinics, hospitals, specialty practices, and RCM teams prepare complete PA packages before submission
  - Not a coverage determination engine — the payer makes the final decision; this system helps the provider team present the strongest, most complete submission
  - Evidence-grounded: the Clinical Evidence Retrieval Agent only reports what is documented in the clinical notes; it explicitly identifies missing evidence
  - Human review required before submission: staff accept or revise the AI assessment
</details>

<details open>
  <summary><b>Multi-agent parallel execution</b></summary>

  - Documentation Completeness and Clinical Evidence Retrieval agents run concurrently via `asyncio.gather`, reducing wall-clock time from 20+ minutes to under 2 minutes per case
  - Policy Matching Agent runs sequentially after clinical findings are available
  - Submission Readiness Agent executes the gate-based rubric to generate the final assessment and confidence
  - Four-phase pipeline: Pre-flight → Parallel → Policy Matching → Submission Readiness → Readiness Report
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Foundry Hosted Agent architecture</b></summary>

  - Each of the 4 specialist agents has its own `main.py`, `schemas.py`, `Dockerfile`, `agent.yaml`, and `skills/` directory under `agents/<name>/`
  - Every agent runs as a Foundry Hosted Agent on the `azure-ai-agentserver` Responses protocol host (`azure-ai-agentserver-core` + `azure-ai-agentserver-responses`). The two tool-using agents (Clinical Evidence Retrieval, Policy Matching) drive the model with the OpenAI SDK via `client.responses.parse(text_format=PydanticModel)` against the Foundry Responses API at `{AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}/openai/v1`; the two pure-LLM agents (Documentation Completeness, Submission Readiness) use the Microsoft Agent Framework (`AzureOpenAIResponsesClient` with `default_options={"response_format": PydanticModel}`). Both paths enforce token-level structured output — no JSON fence parsing
  - Each agent's behavior is defined by its `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, loaded into the system prompt at startup (the tool-using agents inline it directly; the Microsoft Agent Framework agents load it via `SkillsProvider`)
  - The FastAPI backend is a **pure HTTP dispatcher** — it has no local AI runtime; all specialist reasoning runs in the four independent agent containers
  - Each agent container exposes `POST /responses` (Foundry Responses API protocol, version `1.0.0`) and is independently versioned, deployable, and scalable
  - `hosted_agents.py` is a **two-mode dispatcher**: direct HTTP to agent containers (Docker Compose), or each agent's dedicated Responses endpoint `{AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}/agents/{name}/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses` with `DefaultAzureCredential` (Foundry Hosted Agents)
  - Resilience: if tools or the model call fail, an agent returns a schema-valid degraded result (HTTP 200, conservative manual-review payload) instead of erroring
  - Agents are registered with Foundry via `scripts/register_agents.py` (postprovision hook in `azure.yaml`), which creates an immutable version and routes 100% endpoint traffic to it — Foundry manages the ACA container lifecycle; no self-managed ACA modules in Bicep
  - `scripts/check_agents.py` runs automatically after registration to verify all agents, App Insights, toolboxes, backend, and frontend are healthy before the deployment completes
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Skills-based architecture</b></summary>

  - Agent behaviors defined in SKILL.md files — domain experts can update payer policy rules without code changes
  - SKILL.md files live alongside each agent container under `agents/<name>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
  - Loaded into each agent's system prompt at startup — no backend code changes needed to update clinical rules
  - Documentation Completeness skill: 10-item checklist (NCCI bundling + service type classification added as items 9 and 10)
  - Policy Matching skill: Provider Specialty-Procedure Appropriateness is a required explicit criterion (Step 1.4)
  - Clinical Evidence Retrieval skill: low-confidence extraction banner when `extraction_confidence < 60%` surfaces directly in the frontend Clinical tab
  - Submission Readiness skill: emits `synthesis_audit_trail` (gate results + weighted confidence breakdown) visible in the frontend Synthesis tab
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>MCP-powered data access</b></summary>

  - The Clinical Evidence Retrieval and Policy Matching agents consume MCP tools through **Foundry Toolboxes** — two project-scoped managed MCP endpoints named `clinical-tools` (icd10, pubmed, clinical_trials) and `coverage-tools` (npi, cms_coverage)
  - A Foundry Toolbox is a managed MCP endpoint on the Foundry project domain (`{project_endpoint}/toolboxes/{name}/mcp?api-version=v1`); the agent connects to it as an MCP client (streamable-HTTP) using its managed-identity bearer token plus the `Foundry-Features: Toolboxes=V1Preview` header, and the toolbox proxies tool calls out to the backing MCP servers from Foundry's own network
  - Tools are exposed to the model as `{server_label}___{tool_name}` (for example `icd10___validate_code`)
  - Backing MCP servers: a self-hosted **medical-data** MCP server (Streamable HTTP, stateless, public read-only reference data, no secrets) running as an Azure Container App that wraps free official public APIs — ICD-10 (NLM Clinical Tables), Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov v2), NPI (CMS NPPES Registry), and CMS Coverage (api.coverage.cms.gov); plus the public PubMed MCP server at `https://pubmed.mcp.claude.com/mcp` (unauthenticated)
  - Both tool-using agents run gpt-5.4 via the OpenAI SDK `responses.parse`, driving a tool-calling loop over the toolbox tools to a structured result
  - Toolboxes are created and verified by `scripts/create_toolbox.py` and visible in the Foundry portal under **Build → Tools**
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Gate-based submission readiness evaluation</b></summary>

  - Three sequential gates: Provider Credentials → Code and Order Validation → Payer Policy Requirements
  - Submission readiness: only READY_TO_SUBMIT or NEEDS_REVIEW — never makes coverage approvals or denials
  - Per-criterion MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT assessment with confidence scoring
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Human-in-the-loop staff review panel</b></summary>

  - Accept or Revise the AI assessment with documented rationale
  - Override traceability: flows to provider letters, audit PDF, and API response
  - Reference number generation (PA-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX)
  - PDF provider letters (submission ready and documentation needed) with clinical evidence data
  - All four agents visible in tabbed Agent Details: Documentation Completeness checklist, Clinical Evidence extraction (with low-confidence banner), Policy Matching criteria (including specialty-procedure match), and **Submission Readiness** gate pipeline + weighted confidence breakdown + disclaimer
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Audit and compliance</b></summary>

  - 10-item documentation completeness checklist with blocking/non-blocking classification; items 9 (NCCI bundling risk) and 10 (service type classification) are domain-aware improvements over the baseline Anthropic skill
  - Provider Specialty-Procedure Appropriateness as a required, auditable `criteria_assessment` entry in the Policy Matching Agent — sourced from NPI Registry taxonomy
  - Per-criterion confidence scoring with weighted formula (40% criteria + 30% extraction + 20% compliance + 10% policy)
  - `synthesis_audit_trail` with `gate_results` and `confidence_components` surfaced in the frontend Synthesis tab
  - 8-section audit justification document (Markdown + color-coded PDF)
  - Diagnosis-Policy Alignment as a required auditable criterion
  - Complete data source attribution and timestamp tracking
  - Section 9 added on clinician override with full override record
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Real-time progress streaming</b></summary>

  - SSE (Server-Sent Events) for live progress updates
  - Phase timeline with per-agent status cards and elapsed timer
  - 9 progress events across 5 phases (preflight → phase_1 → phase_2 → phase_3 → phase_4)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Observability</b></summary>

  - Azure Application Insights integration via OpenTelemetry
  - Custom phase spans with semantic attributes (recommendation, confidence, agent status)
  - Microsoft Foundry hosted agents provide native runtime and evaluation visibility when hosted mode is enabled
  - Application Map, Transaction Search, Live Metrics, and Performance views
</details>

### Prerequisites and costs

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create resource groups and resources. The **Microsoft Foundry Resource and Project** are automatically provisioned by `azd up`. The solution uses the **Azure OpenAI gpt-5.4** model, which is automatically deployed as part of `azd up` — see [Azure OpenAI model availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) for details.

> [!WARNING]
> **Region and deployment type:** gpt-5.4 is available in **East US 2** (`eastus2`) and **Sweden Central** (`swedencentral`).
>
> | Deployment Type | Data Residency | Regions |
> |----------------|---------------|--------|
> | **GlobalStandard** (default) | No guarantee — data may be processed in any region | East US 2, Sweden Central |
> | **DataZoneStandard** | Data stays within geographic zone (US/EU) | East US 2 **only** |
>
> - **Sweden Central** automatically uses **GlobalStandard** (the only supported type for that region) — no prompt is shown.
> - **East US 2** prompts you to choose between **GlobalStandard** and **DataZoneStandard** during `azd up`.
>
> If you need data residency, select East US 2 and choose DataZoneStandard. See [Azure OpenAI model availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) for the latest availability.

<a id="business-scenario"></a>
## <img src="./docs/images/readme/business-scenario.svg" width="48" /> Business Scenario

|![Prior Authorization Review — Application Interface](./docs/images/readme/interface.png)|
|---|

<br/>

Provider organizations processing prior authorization (PA) requests are coordinating work across referral teams, utilization review nurses, ordering clinicians, medical directors, and revenue cycle operations. The core challenge is not just reviewing a case — it is assembling a **payer-ready provider packet** quickly enough to meet operational timelines while preserving auditability.

Some of the pressures providers face include:

- **High volume** — U.S. providers submit ~[300 million PA requests per year](https://www.caqh.org/insights/caqh-index-report) (CAQH Index)
- **Manual, time-consuming review prep** — each request takes [15–20 minutes](https://web.archive.org/web/20240829144735/https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/prior-authorization-survey.pdf) of clinician and staff time (AMA, 2024)
- **Slow payer turnaround** — average PA decision takes [5–14 business days](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-interoperability-and-prior-authorization-final-rule-cms-0057-f)
- **Fragmented source systems** — order details, clinical notes, imaging, payer rules, and attachments often live in different work queues
- **Regulatory pressure** — CMS mandates [electronic PA by 2026–2027](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-interoperability-and-prior-authorization-final-rule-cms-0057-f) with 72-hour urgent and 7-day standard response limits (CMS-0057-F)

By using the *Provider Prior Authorization Multi-Agent Solution Accelerator*, organizations can standardize how provider teams prepare complete PA packages, identify missing evidence before submission, and preserve a human-reviewed audit trail for payer follow-up and appeal readiness.

### Where this fits in a provider organization

| Provider team / system | What they contribute | How this solution helps |
|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Referral / scheduling | Requested service, ordering context, facility, payer, urgency | Structures intake and flags missing operational details early |
| Utilization review / PA team | Documentation packet assembly, payer portal submission, resubmission work | Surfaces documentation gaps and submission-readiness checkpoints |
| Ordering provider / rendering specialist | Clinical rationale, prior treatment history, diagnostics, specialty alignment | Converts clinical narrative into auditable evidence summaries |
| Medical director / physician reviewer | Escalations, override rationale, appeal readiness | Supports human revision with full traceability |
| Revenue cycle / authorization ops | Follow-up, status tracking, denial prevention | Standardizes outputs for work queues, letters, and downstream reporting |
| EHR / referral / document systems | Patient, encounter, coverage, attachments, orders | Provides an orchestration layer that can sit between existing provider systems and payer workflows |

### Provider workflow journey

1. **Referral or order intake** — capture the requested service, ordering provider, servicing location, payer, plan, urgency, and baseline diagnosis/procedure codes.
2. **Documentation prep** — assemble chart notes, imaging, pathology, prior treatment history, and required attachments from the EHR, referral platform, or fax/document queue.
3. **Clinical review** — validate the story being told to the payer: severity, failed treatment, diagnostics, comorbidities, and specialty-procedure fit.
4. **Payer submission readiness** — determine whether the packet is complete enough to submit or whether staff should pause and request missing information.
5. **Staff follow-up** — generate a repeatable summary for the PA coordinator or revenue-cycle work queue when resubmission is needed.
6. **Appeal readiness** — preserve an auditable summary and human override rationale if a clinician revises the AI recommendation.

### Concrete provider scenarios

| Scenario | Provider persona | Real-world issue | What the accelerator demonstrates |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Advanced imaging / biopsy escalation | Pulmonology PA coordinator | Imaging and consult data exist, but the final packet may still be missing indexed reports or consent support | A near-submission-ready case with imaging evidence, failed conservative treatment, and specialty alignment |
| Specialty drug / infusion authorization | Oncology pre-cert specialist | Line-of-therapy, biomarker, site-of-care, and drug policy rules must all line up | How the workflow handles specialty drug documentation and policy mapping before first-cycle scheduling |
| Outpatient surgery scheduling | Utilization review nurse + surgery scheduler | Conservative treatment history and imaging support must be packaged before an OR date is finalized | How clinical evidence and documentation gaps affect surgical submission readiness |
| DME / home health setup | Discharge planner / DME coordinator | Face-to-face timing, qualifying tests, and supplier paperwork are often scattered across systems | How the workflow packages home-based service requests and highlights missing operational attachments |

### Business value
<details>
  <summary>Click to learn more about what value this solution provides</summary>

  - **Reduce packet-prep time from 20+ minutes to under 2 minutes** <br/>
  Compliance and Clinical agents run concurrently via parallel execution, dramatically reducing wall-clock time per case.

  - **Improve first-pass submission quality** <br/>
  Provider teams can find documentation gaps before they submit to the payer, reducing rework and avoidable pend requests.

  - **Maintain human oversight** <br/>
  AI produces draft recommendations; human reviewers can submit as-is or revise with documented rationale — every decision is traceable.

  - **Scale without proportional staffing** <br/>
  Stateless API design enables horizontal scaling behind a load balancer. Skills-based architecture lets domain experts update clinical rules without code changes.

  - **Support downstream appeals and audits** <br/>
  Automated documentation generation (notification letters, audit PDFs, override summaries) gives provider teams a reusable record for payer follow-up.

  | Scenario | Persona | Challenges | Solution Approach |
  |----------|---------|------------|-------------------|
  | PA intake triage | Utilization Review Nurse | Manually checking demographics, ordering context, provider credentials, codes, and note quality is time-consuming and error-prone. | **Compliance Agent** validates all required documentation in seconds with a 10-item checklist: items 1-7 are blocking; item 9 flags NCCI CPT bundling risk; item 10 classifies service type (Procedure/Medication/Imaging/Device/Therapy/Facility) for downstream routing. |
  | Clinical evidence review | Medical Director | Extracting structured clinical data, validating ICD-10 codes, and searching literature for supporting evidence takes 15–30 minutes per case. | **Clinical Reviewer Agent** automates clinical data extraction, code validation, and literature/trial search using MCP-connected healthcare data sources. |
  | Coverage policy evaluation | PA Coordinator | Looking up Medicare NCDs/LCDs, mapping policy criteria to clinical evidence, and documenting medical necessity assessments is manual and inconsistent. | **Coverage Agent** searches CMS coverage databases, verifies provider credentials, and produces auditable MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT criterion mappings. |
  | Submission readiness and escalation | PA Coordinator + physician reviewer | Combining findings from multiple reviewers into a consistent packet-ready recommendation with confidence scoring requires significant coordination. | **Orchestrator + Synthesis** evaluates a gate-based rubric (Provider → Codes → Medical Necessity), produces a recommendation with confidence scores, and generates notification letters and audit PDFs for staff follow-up. |

### Security guidelines

This solution accelerator handles **Protected Health Information (PHI)** and clinical data. Security best practices are critical for any deployment.

**This project uses keyless authentication throughout — no API keys, passwords, or connection strings are stored anywhere.** All Azure resource access (Microsoft Foundry, Azure Container Registry, Azure Monitor) is authenticated via [`DefaultAzureCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication/credential-chains#defaultazurecredential-overview):

| Environment | Credential used | How it's granted |
|---|---|---|
| Azure (production) | System-assigned [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) on each Container App; deployer user identity | Bicep role assignments at deploy time (`CognitiveServicesOpenAIUser` for backend, `CognitiveServicesOpenAIContributor` + `Azure AI User` for Foundry project MI, `Azure AI User` for deployer) |
| Local / Codespaces | Azure Developer CLI token (`azd auth login`) or Azure CLI token (`az login`) | Developer's own authenticated session |

Because there are no API keys, there is nothing to rotate, leak, or accidentally commit. To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend enabling [GitHub secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) to catch any credentials that might be inadvertently introduced.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/) to secure your Azure resources.
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
* Enabling [encryption at rest](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest) for all data stores containing PHI.
* Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can submit, review, and override prior authorization decisions.
* Ensuring HIPAA compliance by signing a [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-hipaa-us) with Microsoft for production workloads.
